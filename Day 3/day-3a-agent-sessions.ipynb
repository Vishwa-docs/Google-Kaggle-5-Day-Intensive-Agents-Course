Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, there are **very significant and rapid developments** in AI-driven drug discovery. It's one of the most active and promising areas where AI is making a tangible impact in healthcare.\n\nHere are some of the key new developments and trends:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n*   **De Novo Design:** This is a major leap. Instead of just screening existing libraries, AI is now used to *design entirely new molecules* from scratch that have desired properties (e.g., bind to a specific target, have good solubility, minimal toxicity). Models learn the \"language\" of chemistry and can propose novel structures.\n*   **Property Optimization:** Generative AI can iteratively refine molecule designs to optimize multiple properties simultaneously, a task that's incredibly complex for human chemists.\n\n**2. Advanced Target Identification and Validation:**\n*   **Unveiling Novel Targets:** AI can sift through massive amounts of genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data to identify new biological targets implicated in diseases that were previously unknown or poorly understood.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI models are improving at predicting whether a newly identified target is likely to be \"druggable\" – meaning a molecule can effectively interact with it to produce a therapeutic effect.\n\n**3. Accelerating Preclinical Testing and Lead Optimization:**\n*   **In Silico Screening:** AI is making virtual screening of vast compound libraries much faster and more accurate, predicting which compounds are most likely to be effective.\n*   **Predicting ADMET Properties:** AI is becoming more sophisticated at predicting how a drug will be Absorbed, Distributed, Metabolized, Excreted, and its Toxicity (ADMET). This helps weed out problematic candidates early, saving time and resources.\n*   **Formulation Optimization:** AI can assist in determining the best way to formulate a drug for effective delivery and stability.\n\n**4. Revolutionizing Protein Structure Prediction:**\n*   **AlphaFold and Beyond:** DeepMind's AlphaFold has been a game-changer in predicting the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequence. This is crucial because a protein's structure dictates its function and how drugs can bind to it. New AI models are building on this success, offering even greater speed and accuracy, and predicting protein complexes and interactions.\n\n**5. Leveraging Real-World Data (RWD) and Real-World Evidence (RWE):**\n*   **Patient Stratification:** AI can analyze RWD from electronic health records, claims data, and wearables to identify specific patient subgroups who might benefit most from a particular drug, or to understand disease progression better.\n*   **Predicting Treatment Response:** AI models can learn from RWE to predict how patients will respond to different treatments, informing clinical trial design and post-market surveillance.\n\n**6. AI-Powered Repurposing of Existing Drugs:**\n*   **Finding New Uses:** AI can analyze existing drug data, disease pathways, and biological interactions to identify potential new therapeutic uses for drugs already approved for other conditions. This can significantly shorten the development timeline.\n\n**7. Enhancements in Clinical Trial Design and Execution:**\n*   **Patient Recruitment:** AI can identify eligible patients for clinical trials more efficiently.\n*   **Predicting Trial Success:** AI can analyze historical trial data to predict the likelihood of success for new trials, helping optimize resource allocation.\n\n**Notable Companies and Initiatives:**\n\nMany companies are at the forefront of this revolution, including:\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its AI-driven drug discovery platform that has brought novel candidates to clinical trials.\n*   **Exscientia:** Another leader in AI-driven drug design and discovery.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Uses AI and automation to map human genetics and cellular biology to discover treatments.\n*   **Atomwise:** Specializes in using deep learning for small molecule drug discovery.\n*   **Schrödinger:** A long-standing player in computational drug discovery, now heavily integrating AI.\n*   **Large Pharmaceutical Companies:** Many major pharma companies (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis, Roche, Merck) have their own AI initiatives or collaborate with AI biotech firms.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite the progress, challenges persist:\n\n*   **Data Quality and Standardization:** AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. Inconsistent or biased data can lead to flawed predictions.\n*   **\"Black Box\" Problem:** Sometimes, the complex AI models can be difficult to interpret, making it hard to understand exactly *why* a particular molecule was designed or a target was identified.\n*   **Translational Challenges:** Successfully translating AI-discovered candidates into effective and safe human medicines is still a rigorous and lengthy process.\n*   **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Ensuring AI-developed drugs meet regulatory standards is an evolving area.\n\nIn summary, AI is no longer just a theoretical tool in drug discovery; it's actively reshaping the entire pipeline, from identifying novel targets to designing new molecules and optimizing preclinical development. The pace of innovation is immense, and we can expect even more breakthroughs in the coming years.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the second development I mentioned: **Advanced Target Identification and Validation.** This is a critical area where AI is fundamentally changing how we approach discovering new medicines.\n\nLet me elaborate on what this entails and why it's so important:\n\n**What is a \"Drug Target\"?**\n\nBefore diving into the AI aspect, it's important to understand what a drug target is. In essence, a drug target is a specific molecule in the body (usually a protein, but sometimes DNA, RNA, or lipids) that plays a crucial role in a disease process.\n\n*   **Example:** In cancer, a target might be a protein that is overactive and drives uncontrolled cell growth. A drug designed to inhibit this protein could potentially stop or slow the cancer's progression.\n*   **The Goal:** The goal of drug discovery is often to find a molecule (a drug) that can interact with (e.g., activate, inhibit, block) a specific disease-related target in a precise way to achieve a therapeutic effect.\n\n**How AI is Advancing Target Identification:**\n\nHistorically, target identification has been a laborious, time-consuming, and often serendipitous process, relying heavily on manual research, hypothesis-driven experiments, and a deep understanding of known biological pathways. AI is revolutionizing this by:\n\n1.  **Analyzing Vast and Complex Datasets:**\n    *   **Omics Data:** AI algorithms can process enormous datasets from genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), metabolomics (metabolites), and epigenomics. These datasets reveal the intricate molecular underpinnings of diseases.\n    *   **Clinical Data:** Electronic Health Records (EHRs), patient registries, and imaging data provide real-world context about disease progression, treatment responses, and patient outcomes.\n    *   **Literature Mining:** AI can \"read\" and synthesize information from millions of scientific publications, extracting relationships, hypotheses, and potential targets that a human researcher might miss or take years to uncover.\n\n2.  **Identifying Novel and Unexpected Targets:**\n    *   **Pattern Recognition:** AI excels at finding subtle, non-obvious patterns and correlations within these massive datasets that are indicative of a role in disease. This can uncover entirely new pathways or proteins that were not previously suspected.\n    *   **Beyond Known Pathways:** Traditional research often focuses on well-studied pathways. AI can help explore the \"dark matter\" of biology, identifying targets in less understood or previously unappreciated biological processes.\n    *   **Disease Heterogeneity:** AI can help identify different molecular drivers of a disease in different patient subgroups, leading to more personalized target discovery.\n\n3.  **Predicting Target Druggability:**\n    *   **Structure-Function Relationship:** By integrating protein structure prediction (like AlphaFold) with other biological data, AI can help assess whether a newly identified target has a \"binding pocket\" where a drug molecule can effectively attach and exert its effect.\n    *   **Predicting Efficacy and Safety:** AI models can also be trained to predict the potential efficacy and even the likelihood of off-target side effects associated with targeting a specific molecule. This helps prioritize targets that are more likely to lead to successful drug development.\n\n4.  **Validating Targets:**\n    *   **Hypothesis Generation and Testing:** AI can generate hypotheses about the role of a specific target in a disease, which can then be experimentally tested.\n    *   **Prioritizing Targets:** AI-driven predictions help researchers prioritize which potential targets are most promising to invest in for further drug development, significantly increasing the efficiency of the R&D process.\n\n**Impact and Significance:**\n\n*   **Faster Discovery:** AI dramatically reduces the time it takes to go from a disease understanding to identifying a viable drug target.\n*   **Unlocking New Therapeutic Avenues:** AI can uncover targets for diseases that have been historically difficult to treat due to a lack of understanding of their molecular basis.\n*   **Reduced Cost:** By identifying more promising targets earlier, AI can help reduce the immense cost associated with drug development by weeding out less viable candidates sooner.\n*   **Precision Medicine:** AI's ability to dissect disease at a molecular level is crucial for developing targeted therapies that are tailored to specific patient populations or even individuals.\n\nIn essence, AI acts as an incredibly powerful \"biological detective,\" sifting through mountains of evidence to uncover the key molecular players that drive disease, and then helping scientists assess whether these players can be effectively modulated by a drug. This is a fundamental shift from the more empirical and hypothesis-driven methods of the past.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies actively involved in **AI-driven drug target identification and validation**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
