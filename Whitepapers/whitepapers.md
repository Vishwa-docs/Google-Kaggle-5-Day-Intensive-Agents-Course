# Day 1 - Introduction to Agents

Artificial intelligence is changing. For years, the focus has been on models that excel at passive, discrete tasks: answering a question, translating text, or generating an image from a prompt. This paradigm, while powerful, requires constant human direction for every step. We're now seeing a paradigm shift, moving from AI that just predicts or creates content to a new class of software capable of autonomous problem-solving and task execution.

This new frontier is built around AI agents. An agent is not simply an AI model in a static workflow; it's a complete application, making plans and taking actions to achieve goals. It combines a Language Model's (LM) ability to reason with the practical ability to act, allowing it to handle complex, multi-step tasks that a model alone cannot. The critical capability is that agents can work on their own, figuring out the next steps needed to reach a goal without a person guiding them at every turn.

# Day 2 - Agent Tools & Interoperability with MCP
In this paper we talk first about the nature of tools used by foundation models: what they are and how to use them. We give some best practices and guidelines for designing effective tools and using them effectively. We then look at the Model Context Protocol, talking about its basic components and some of the challenges and risks it entails. Finally, we take a deeper look at the security challenges posed by MCP as it is introduced in an enterprise environment and connected to high-value external systems.

# Day 3 - Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory
This whitepaper explores the critical role of Sessions and Memory in building stateful, intelligent LLM agents to empower developers to create more powerful, personalized, and persistent AI experiences. To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to remember, learn, and personalize interactions, developers must dynamically assemble and manage information within their context window—a process known as Context Engineering.

# Day 4 - Agent Quality
This is a practical guide from evaluation to observability. We are at the dawn of the agentic era. The transition from predictable, instruction-based tools to autonomous, goal-oriented AI agents presents one of the most profound shifts in software engineering in decades. While these agents unlock incredible capabilities, their inherent non-determinism makes them unpredictable and shatters our traditional models of quality assurance.

This whitepaper serves as a practical guide to this new reality, founded on a simple but radical principle: agent quality is an architectural pillar, not a final testing phase.


# Day 5 - Prototype to Production
This whitepaper provides a comprehensive technical guide to the operational life cycle of AI agents, focusing on deployment, scaling, and productionizing. Building on Day 4's coverage of evaluation and observability, this guide emphasizes how to build the necessary trust to move agents into production through robust CI/CD pipelines and scalable infrastructure. It explores the challenges of transitioning agent-based systems from prototypes to enterprise- grade solutions, with special attention to Agent2Agent (A2A) interoperability. This guide offers practical insights for AI/ML engineers, DevOps professionals, and system architects.
