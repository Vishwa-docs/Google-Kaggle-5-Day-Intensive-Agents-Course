This 5-day online course was crafted by Google’s ML researchers and engineers to help developers explore the foundations and practical applications of AI agents. You’ll learn the core components – models, tools, orchestration, memory and evaluation. Finally, you’ll discover how agents move beyond LLM prototypes to become production-ready systems.   
  
Each day blends conceptual deep dives with hands-on examples, codelabs, and live discussions. By the end, you’ll be ready to build, evaluate, and deploy agents that solve real-world problems.

# Day 1(Introduction to Agents)
Today’s whitepaper introduces Al agents. It presents a taxonomy of agent capabilities, emphasizes the need for an Agent Ops discipline for reliability and governance, and discusses the importance of agent interoperability and security through identity and constrained policies.    
  
In today's codelabs, you'll be building your first AI agent and your first multi-agent system, using ADK, powered by Gemini, and giving it the ability to use Google Search to answer questions with up-to-date information. In the second codelab, the focus will be on multi-agent systems, where you'll learn how to create teams of specialized agents and explore different architectural patterns.

# Day 2 (Agent Tools & Interoperability with Model Context Protocol (MCP))
Today’s whitepaper focuses on external tools functions that allow an agent to perform actions or retrieve real-time data beyond its training set and introduces best practices for designing effective tools. You'll learn about MCP, highlighting its architectural components, communication layer, risks and enterprise readiness gaps.    
  
In today's codelabs, you will create custom tools for your agents by turning your own Python functions into actions your agent can perform. You'll also use MCP and implement long-running operations where an agent can pause tool calls while waiting for human approval, before resuming.

# Day 3 (Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory)
This whitepaper explores context engineering as the practice of dynamically assembling and managing information within an agent's context window to create stateful and personalized Al experiences. It defines Sessions as the container for a single, immediate conversation's history, and Memory as the long-term persistence mechanism.  
  
In the codelabs, you will learn how to make agents stateful by managing conversation history through context engineering in ADK, and working memory within a session, allowing your agent to remember context and have coherent, multi-turn conversations. In the second notebook, you'll give your agent long-term memory that persists across different sessions.

# Day 4 (Agent Quality)
This whitepaper addresses the challenge of assuring quality in Al agents by introducing a holistic evaluation framework. The necessary technical foundation for this is Observability, built on three pillars: Logs (the diary), Traces (the narrative), and Metrics (the health report), enabling a continuous feedback loop using scalable methods like LLM-as-a-Judge and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) evaluation.  
  
For today's codelabs, you'll learn how to use logs, traces, and metrics to get full visibility into your agent's decision-making process, allowing you to debug failures and understand why your agent behaves the way it does. In the second codelab, you'll learn how to evaluate your agents to score your agent's response quality and tool usage.

# Day 5 (Prototype to Production)
Welcome to Day 5 - we’ve reached the last day’s assignment! 🎉  
  
This whitepaper provides a technical guide to the operational lifecycle of AI agents, focusing on deployment, scaling and productionization. It explores the challenges of transitioning agentic systems from prototypes to enterprise-grade solutions, with special attention to Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol.  
  
For today's codelabs, you'll learn how to build systems of multiple, independent agents that can communicate and collaborate using A2A Protocol. You'll also learn how to take your agent from your local machine to a production-ready, scalable service, by deploying your agent to Vertex AI Agent Engine on Google Cloud.
